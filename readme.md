# w01d01 CLI

## Introduction to the Terminal

We learned how to execute some scripts on the command line during Installfest. You will soon find that the command line is the heart of your operating system. Almost anything you can do from a GUI (Graphical User Interface), you can also do from the command line, but FASTER! We'll learn how to navigate computer files and folders using the terminal; this will help us begin pushing our projects to GitHub.
